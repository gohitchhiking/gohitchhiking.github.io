Each place offers unique advantages and attractions, so let’s compare them in order to help you make an informed decision about where to live in Quintana Roo.\n1. Cancun - The Ultimate Tourist Destination Cancun is undoubtedly the most famous destination among the three. It is known for its vibrant tourism industry, with a plethora of hotels, resorts, and amenities. If you’re looking for a place that feels like home with a wide range of Western amenities, Cancun may be the best fit for you.\nApart from the city center, where you can find all the action and amenities, there are also many condos and apartments on the outskirts that cater to foreigners. These properties often come with great amenities like pools, playgrounds, and gyms. Getting around in Cancun is relatively easy, thanks to taxis, moto-taxis, and even popular ride-sharing services like DD.\nWhile Cancun offers stunning beaches and picturesque views, it lacks significant integration of nature and jungle into the city landscape, focusing more on concrete development. However, if you’re craving a taste of nature, a short boat ride to Isla Mujeres can provide a refreshing change. Isla Mujeres is popular for day trips or even overnight stays, with its beautiful beaches and opportunities for exploration.\nIn terms of affordability, Cancun offers the most options for shops, restaurants, and amenities. You can find an Airbnb for less than $250 per month, making it the most budget-friendly option on our list. For those interested in buying a property, there are high-quality condos available within the range of $30,000 to $50,000.\nMoreover, living in Cancun has the advantage of being close to an international airport, making it convenient for frequent travelers or expats who want easy access to their home countries.\n2. Playa del Carmen - A Harmonious Blend of Tourism and Tranquility Playa del Carmen is a slightly less intense tourist destination than Cancun but still offers a vibrant atmosphere. While it may not have the same level of fame as Cancun, Playa del Carmen has its own unique charm.\nLike Cancun, Playa del Carmen has various living options ranging from the city center, which is walkable and full of amenities, to the outskirts, where you can find beautiful condos reminiscent of hip neighborhoods like Barcelona. Playa del Carmen is also known for its party scene and attracts many young people who love to socialize.\nIn terms of transportation, while ride-sharing services like Uber and DD are not available in Playa del Carmen, secret WhatsApp groups exist where you can request taxis. These groups provide a convenient way to get around the city. Playa del Carmen boasts a well-developed infrastructure and is a popular destination for digital nomads due to its fast internet speeds and accessible cafes with free Wi-Fi.\nPlaya del Carmen may not have beaches as stunning as Cancun, but it compensates with closer proximity to nature and jungle. The city has more trees, wildlife, and a relaxed vibe that can be calming for residents. Additionally, Playa del Carmen provides easy access to scenic spots like Tulum and numerous cenotes, underground freshwater caves that offer a unique experience.\nThe cost of living in Playa del Carmen is slightly higher than in Cancun. Rental prices for a decent Airbnb start at just under $300 per month. If you’re considering buying a property, condos in Playa del Carmen range from $40,000 to $50,000.\nWhile Playa del Carmen does not have its own international airport, it is still reasonably close to the Cancun airport, taking about an hour to reach. This makes it accessible for international travel but not as convenient as living in Cancun.\n3. Cozumel - A Haven for Nature Enthusiasts If you’re a nature lover seeking a more local and laid-back experience, Cozumel might be the perfect fit for you. Unlike its counterparts, Cozumel is less tourist-oriented and offers a slower pace of life.\nCozumel’s touristy area is mainly concentrated near the port, with a few blocks filled with shops and attractions. However, once you venture away from the port area, you’ll find a more authentic local experience. The roads are slower, taxi drivers are calmer, and the absence of ride-sharing services adds to the charm of this island.\nOne of the major advantages of living in Cozumel is the integration of nature and jungle into the cityscape. The island boasts a significant amount of greenery, providing a serene and peaceful environment. Exploring the island is a breeze, whether by renting a car or a motorcycle. The eastern side of Cozumel, known as the “wild side,” offers untouched beaches and opportunities to experience nature in all its glory, including the chance to surf.\nLiving costs in Cozumel are higher compared to both Cancun and Playa del Carmen. Renting an Airbnb starts at around $400 per month, and buying a small house can be upwards of $75,000. Condos range from a few hundred thousand dollars.\nCozumel has a small airport that connects to Cancun and Playa del Carmen, making it possible to travel internationally, albeit with a little more effort than the other two destinations.\nConclusion: Which Place Is Right for You? In summary, choosing between Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Cozumel depends on your preferences and priorities. Cancun offers a bustling city with quality amenities, stunning beaches, and a budget-friendly cost of living. Playa del Carmen combines a relaxed lifestyle with a vibrant social scene and convenient infrastructure. Cozumel provides a slower pace of life, integrating nature into the city and offering a more local experience.\nConsider the factors that matter most to you, from the cost of living and access to Western amenities to the proximity to nature and beaches, before making a decision. Each destination offers its own unique charm, and Quintana Roo is truly a region that offers something for everyone.\nLet us know in the comments which place you would choose among these three, and if you’re interested in learning more about moving to Mexico, check out our video on “Three Easy Ways to Move to Mexico.”\n","wordCount":"1024","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Charlena White"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/cozumel-vs-playa-del-carmen/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Go Hitch Hiking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Go Hitch Hiking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Go Hitch Hiking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Cancun vs. Cozumel vs. Playa del Carmen: Comparing the Best Places to Live in Quintana Roo, Mexico</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 27, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1024 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Charlena White</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-cancun---the-ultimate-tourist-destination>1.
