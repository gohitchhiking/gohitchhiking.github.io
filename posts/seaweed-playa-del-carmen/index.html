The video transcript from the YouTube channel “Doctry 360” will serve as our main source of information. We will discuss the current conditions of the beaches, highlighting various resort areas along the coast. Additionally, we will provide step-by-step descriptions of the aerial views shown in the video, giving readers a comprehensive understanding of the beach conditions in Playa Del Carmen.\nOverview of the Seaweed Situation Seaweed, also known as sargasso, has been a concern for the beaches of Playa Del Carmen for the past year. The video host mentions that he has been providing updates for over a year, starting in mid-July the previous year. However, it is important to note that there is a positive trend in seaweed conditions, as this August has been considerably better compared to the same time last year.\nAerial Views: Punta Esmeralda and Paradisus The video begins with an aerial view of Punta Esmeralda, where the host mentions that the seaweed situation has improved significantly compared to last August. The host also showcases the beautiful beachfront and the presence of vendors selling delicious mangoes and “chumu” (spicy seasoning).\nMoving on, the video provides an over-the-top view of Paradisus, another prominent resort area. The host emphasizes that the beach looks clean and that there is hardly any seaweed along the shoreline.\nAerial Views: Playa 88 and Colosseo Continuing the aerial tour, the video showcases Playa 88, which had slightly cloudy water but no significant amount of seaweed detected. Similarly, the Colosseo area appears to be in good condition, with some cleaning crews spotted removing seaweed in the morning.\nAerial Views: Reef Cocoa Beach and Elements The Reef Cocoa Beach is featured next, with the video offering an overhead view of the resort area. The host observes that it looks decent and appears to be an all-inclusive option for visitors.\nMoving along, the Elements and Mandarinos areas are highlighted, with no notable seaweed accumulation on the beachfront. Martina Beach Club, known for its popularity on hot days, shows a crowded scene with many people enjoying the water.\nAerial Views: In Kanto, 38th Street, and Mahekal Beach Club In Kanto Beach Club, there is minimal seaweed present, and the water appears clear. The host then brings attention to 38th Street Beach, which is characterized by crowds of beachgoers entering from the designated entrance. Mahekal Beach Club, considered a top spot, is showcased from above and is noted for its attractive location.\nAerial Views: My Meeters and Grand Hyatt Next, the video presents My Meeters and Grand Hyatt as two notable resort areas. While My Meeters is relatively uncrowded and has some floating seaweed in the water, Grand Hyatt has a beach present, although it is typically nonexistent with higher tides.\nAerial Views: Hilton, Ultra Windham, and Lower Centro The Hilton resort is shown with a low tide, allowing for ample beach space and visible reefs and rocks. The Ultra Windham area is briefly featured, followed by a mention of Lower Centro, where the seaweed situation is said to have improved compared to previous weeks. Zenzi Beach is passed by during this segment.\nAerial Views: El Faro, Pelicanos, and Pez Vela El Faro catches the host’s attention as an area that appears lighter than before, indicating a positive change in beach conditions. Pelicanos is shown briefly, and the video finally presents the parking area near Pez Vela, which seems to have been well-maintained by the municipality of Playa Del Carmen.\nAerial Views: Playa Del Carmen Phase 1 and Phase 2 The video continues with aerial shots of Playa Del Carmen Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 is described as having improved since last week, with some remaining seaweed but not as severe as before. Phase 2 still has a brownish-green hue along the beach line, but the situation has gotten slightly better compared to the previous week.\nConclusion and Assistance The host acknowledges that August is typically the worst month for seaweed in Playa Del Carmen but comments that the current conditions are relatively good for this time of year. He encourages viewers to donate or make special requests, providing support to continue these informative reports. By keeping up with the updates, potential travelers can make more informed decisions when planning their trips to Playa Del Carmen.\nOverall, it can be concluded that the seaweed situation in Playa Del Carmen has shown improvement compared to the previous year. Various resort areas along the beachfront have reported cleaner conditions, with minimal seaweed present. The efforts of cleaning crews and the municipality of Playa Del Carmen have contributed to the positive changes observed in the beach’s overall appearance.\nDonations and special requests can be made at buy me a coffee.com 360 if viewers appreciate these reports that assist in trip planning and provide up-to-date information on the seaweed conditions in Playa Del Carmen.\nRemember, if you are considering visiting Playa Del Carmen, it is essential to stay informed about the current seaweed situation by referring to reliable sources such as the Doctry 360 YouTube channel and other official updates.\n","wordCount":"866","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeannette Doran"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/seaweed-playa-del-carmen/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Go Hitch Hiking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Go Hitch Hiking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Go Hitch Hiking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Playa Del Carmen Beach Seaweed Update August 19th 2023: Current Conditions and Resort Highlights</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 27, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;866 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jeannette Doran</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#overview-of-the-seaweed-situation>Overview of the Seaweed Situation</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-punta-esmeralda-and-paradisus>Aerial Views: Punta Esmeralda and Paradisus</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-playa-88-and-colosseo>Aerial Views: Playa 88 and Colosseo</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-reef-cocoa-beach-and-elements>Aerial Views: Reef Cocoa Beach and Elements</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-in-kanto-38th-street-and-mahekal-beach-club>Aerial Views: In Kanto, 38th Street, and Mahekal Beach Club</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-my-meeters-and-grand-hyatt>Aerial Views: My Meeters and Grand Hyatt</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-hilton-ultra-windham-and-lower-centro>Aerial Views: Hilton, Ultra Windham, and Lower Centro</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-el-faro-pelicanos-and-pez-vela>Aerial Views: El Faro, Pelicanos, and Pez Vela</a></li><li><a href=#aerial-views-playa-del-carmen-phase-1-and-phase-2>Aerial Views: Playa Del Carmen Phase 1 and Phase 2</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion-and-assistance>Conclusion and Assistance</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gSmaanvo6c style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In this article, we will provide you with the latest update on the seaweed (sargasso) situation in Playa Del Carmen, specifically on August 19th, 2023.
