Both sides offer stunning features that cater to different types of travelers. In this article, we will compare the major highlights of both destinations to help you determine whether Puerto Vallarta or the Cancun/Riviera Maya is a better fit for your family vacation.\nCancun: The Ultimate Tropical All-Inclusive Getaway If you’re looking for a tropical, all-inclusive vacation, Cancun is the perfect destination. Whether you’re traveling as a family with kids or a couple on your honeymoon, Cancun offers something for everyone. The Riviera Maya side of Mexico, which includes Cancun, is known for its luxurious resorts and endless activities.\nKey points about Cancun:\nAll-inclusive resorts: Cancun is renowned for its all-inclusive resorts where you can enjoy lounging by the pool, swim-up bars, and long walks on the beach without ever leaving the resort. It’s a great choice for families who want a hassle-free vacation where everything is taken care of.\nFamily-friendly activities: Cancun offers a wide range of activities for kids, including kids’ clubs and water parks within the resorts. There are also numerous adventurous excursions such as snorkeling, whale watching, cenote swimming, ATV tours, and zip-lining that will keep the whole family entertained.\nLuxurious retreats for couples: Couples looking for a romantic and luxurious escape will find plenty of ultra-luxurious resorts and amenities in Cancun. It’s the perfect place to celebrate your honeymoon or anniversary in style.\nTurquoise waters and Mayan ruins: Cancun boasts stunning turquoise waters, fascinating Mayan ruins, and breathtaking cenotes (underground freshwater pools and river systems). The region also features large eco-resort style parks that offer beautiful natural outdoor experiences.\nPuerto Vallarta: Immerse Yourself in Authentic Mexico If you prefer to immerse yourself in the authentic side of Mexico while still having the option to stay at an all-inclusive resort or vacation rental, Puerto Vallarta is the ideal destination. It offers a perfect blend of cultural experiences, natural beauty, and opportunities for adventure.\nKey points about Puerto Vallarta:\nAuthentic Mexican experience: Puerto Vallarta’s old town center with its cobblestone streets, Spanish colonial buildings, beach boardwalks, and vibrant nightlife offers a truly authentic Mexican experience.\nAll-inclusive or vacation rental options: In Puerto Vallarta, you have the choice to stay at an all-inclusive resort or in the heart of downtown at a vacation rental or an Airbnb. This flexibility allows you to tailor your vacation to fit your preferences and budget.\nFamily-friendly activities and adventures: Just like the Cancun side, Puerto Vallarta also offers options for families, such as resorts and hotels with kids’ clubs and water parks. Additionally, there are numerous adventurous activities such as snorkeling, whale watching, cenote swimming, ATV tours, and zip-lining that will keep your family entertained.\nBeaches and natural beauty: Puerto Vallarta boasts swimmable beaches thanks to its location in Banderas Bay, which protects the area from large swells. The beaches in Puerto Vallarta may not have the white sands and turquoise waters of Cancun but they offer a unique charm and are still warm enough for swimming. Moreover, the area is known for its breathtaking sunsets, offering a magical and romantic atmosphere.\nComparing Beaches, Water, and Climate The beaches and water in both destinations have their unique qualities. If you are looking for a picture-perfect tropical vacation with white sandy beaches and turquoise blue water, the Caribbean side of Mexico, including Cancun, is the place to be. However, it’s important to note that the Caribbean side has been experiencing issues with sargassum, a type of seaweed that washes up on shore and can turn the water a light brown or beige color. This is a factor to consider if you prioritize pristine water for swimming.\nOn the other hand, the beaches on the Pacific side of Mexico, including Puerto Vallarta, have a golden color and a slightly grainier texture compared to the beaches in Cancun. However, pockets of softer and lighter-colored sand can still be found. The water in Puerto Vallarta is warm enough for swimming and the area is protected from large swells, making it safe and enjoyable for beach activities.\nWhen it comes to climate, Cancun has a more humid climate, especially during its high season from January to April. Puerto Vallarta, on the other hand, enjoys consistently pleasant weather during its peak tourist months of December to March, with mild temperatures at night. Both destinations have shoulder season months, such as November and April, which are also great times to visit with fewer tourists and potentially lower prices.\nExcursions, Activities, and Cultural Experiences Both Cancun and Puerto Vallarta offer a wide range of activities, excursions, and cultural experiences that cater to all types of travelers.\nIn the Cancun/Riviera Maya area, the must-visit attractions include the cenotes and Mayan ruins. These unique natural wonders are found only on this side of Mexico and provide an unforgettable experience. Snorkeling is also a popular activity, and there are hidden islands full of marine life that can be explored with a tour. For a full-day adventure, visiting Chichen Itza, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, is highly recommended. This tour also includes a stop at Viadolid, a beautiful small city with a historic Spanish colonial downtown center.\nOn the Puerto Vallarta side, a stroll along the Malecon, the boardwalk along the beach, is a must. The Zona Romantica, the old downtown area, offers a unique mix of Spanish colonial and Mexican architecture, reminiscent of European charm. There are also endless day trip options to small fishing villages and surfer towns, allowing you to explore the rich culture and local flavors of the area. Nature lovers can enjoy the coastal mountains and jungle terrain, which offer hidden gem places to visit and hiking opportunities. From December to March, whale watching is another highlight of visiting Puerto Vallarta, as the humpback whales put on a spectacular show.\nAdditionally, both destinations offer tequila farm and distillery tours, providing a fun and authentic experience to learn about Mexico’s most famous spirit.\nAccommodations and Safety In terms of accommodations, the Riviera Maya side of Mexico is mostly known for its all-inclusive resorts that line the entire coast. From two-star to luxury five-star resorts, you’ll find a wide range of options. Playa del Carmen, on the Riviera Maya, also offers smaller authentic hotels and excellent dining options that can provide a balance between a beach getaway and a city experience.\nIn Puerto Vallarta, you’ll find a diverse range of accommodations, including high-end luxury resorts, small boutique hotels, locally-owned hotels, vacation rentals, condos, and affordable hotels. The romantic zone, or the Old Town, is a popular area for tourists to stay, with its mix of locals and tourists, beautiful properties overlooking the river, and a variety of dining and entertainment options.\nBoth destinations are generally safe for tourists. In Cancun, if you stay within the resort area, you’ll have nothing to worry about as long as you practice general safety precautions. In Puerto Vallarta, situational awareness is always helpful, especially when exploring the city. However, the area is generally safe, and encounters with any issues are rare. It’s always advisable to keep your belongings secure and close to your body and be aware of potential tourist scams, as with any destination.\nPrice and Overall Experience In terms of price, Puerto Vallarta tends to be slightly cheaper than Cancun. If you’re on a budget and prefer to plan and organize things yourself, Puerto Vallarta offers more affordable options. You can find clean hotels for around $30 to $40 per night and enjoy meals at local restaurants for $5 to $7. Puerto Vallarta also offers a more immersive and culturally rich experience, thanks to its vibrant local scene and friendly locals.\nOverall, the choice between Puerto Vallarta and the Cancun side of Mexico comes down to personal preferences. Both destinations offer beautiful natural landscapes, cultural experiences, and a wide range of activities for families. Whether you prefer a tropical all-inclusive retreat or a more authentic Mexican experience, each side has something unique to offer. Consider your budget, preferences, and the type of vacation you’re looking for to make the best choice for your family.\n","wordCount":"1360","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Susan Viverette"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/cancun-or-puerto-vallarta-with-kids/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Go Hitch Hiking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Go Hitch Hiking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Go Hitch Hiking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Cancun vs. Puerto Vallarta Mexico: Which Side is Better for Your Family Vacation?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 9, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1360 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Susan Viverette</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#cancun-the-ultimate-tropical-all-inclusive-getaway>Cancun: The Ultimate Tropical All-Inclusive Getaway</a></li><li><a href=#puerto-vallarta-immerse-yourself-in-authentic-mexico>Puerto Vallarta: Immerse Yourself in Authentic Mexico</a></li><li><a href=#comparing-beaches-water-and-climate>Comparing Beaches, Water, and Climate</a></li><li><a href=#excursions-activities-and-cultural-experiences>Excursions, Activities, and Cultural Experiences</a></li><li><a href=#accommodations-and-safety>Accommodations and Safety</a></li><li><a href=#price-and-overall-experience>Price and Overall Experience</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nwf200iDkY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Deciding between Puerto Vallarta and the Cancun side of Mexico can be a difficult choice.
