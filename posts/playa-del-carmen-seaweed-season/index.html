It is Saturday, August 19th, 2023, and I am here to provide you with the latest information on the current seaweed situation. As I reflect on the past year, I realize that I have been bringing these reports to you for over a year now. If you find these updates helpful, you can show your support by visiting buy me a coffee.com/360 for donations and special requests.\nLet’s dive right into the Beach Seaweed update for today:\nPunta Esmeralda and Paradisus Resorts We began our journey at Punta Esmeralda, where I noticed a significant improvement compared to the same time last year. August tends to be a challenging month in terms of seaweed, but this year presents a better scenario. As I flew my drone around 2 p.m., I observed the hot weather, characteristic of a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Along the beach, locals offered delicious mangoes with a touch of spicy seasoning called “chumu.”\nMoving towards Paradisus Resorts, I wanted to highlight the state of the beachfront. Thankfully, the resort has done an excellent job in cleaning up the seaweed, resulting in a nearly pristine shoreline. The water, however, appeared slightly cloudier than usual but overall acceptable.\nPlaya 88 and Colosseo Continuing our journey, Playa 88 was slightly cloudy but not heavily affected by seaweed. A thin line of seaweed could be spotted along the beach, but it did not pose a significant issue. As we approached Colosseo, the clarity of the water was not as remarkable as the previous week, yet it was still a tolerable condition. Cleaning crews had been active in the morning, ensuring a cleaner beach experience for visitors.\nReef Cocoa Beach and Elements Resorts Next on our list was Reef Cocoa Beach, where visitors enjoyed the crystal-clear water and the beach club’s amenities. The aerial view showed a picturesque scene, perfect for a relaxing getaway. Moving towards the upper central area, particularly Las Hijas and Elements Resorts, the beach remained relatively free of seaweed. A cloudy day did not deter people from taking a refreshing dip in the water.\nMartina Beach Club and In Kanto Beach Club At Martina Beach Club, the sweltering heat led to a high number of people seeking relief in the water. Although there was a minimal presence of seaweed, it did not hinder the enjoyment of the beach. In Kanto Beach Club offered a similar experience, with clear waters and scarce seaweed visible.\n38th Street Beach and Maheka Beach Club Moving along, 38th Street Beach greeted us with a crowded atmosphere, showcasing the popularity of its entrance. Heading further towards Maheka Beach Club, we encountered what seemed to be an idyllic stretch of beach. The beach club offered an all-inclusive experience, with a prime location for relaxation and enjoyment. However, there was a small amount of floating seaweed in the water, but it did not affect the overall experience.\nPlaya Del Carmen Hotel Zone As we reached the Playa Del Carmen Hotel Zone, we observed varying conditions depending on the specific area. The Grand Hyatt, known for having limited beach space due to higher tides, surprisingly had enough room for beach chairs. The Hilton, with its clear see-through water and low tide, provided ample space for visitors to enjoy the beach.\nLower Central and El Faro Lower Central, a region known for its previous issues with seaweed, showed signs of improvement. While still not perfect, the situation was considerably better compared to previous weeks. Passing by Zenzi Beach and El Faro, we noticed a gradual lightening of the seaweed presence, indicating positive progress by the local municipality in keeping the beach clean.\nNatz Ti Ha and Sunset Beach Clubs Approaching the end of our journey, we flew over Natz Ti Ha and Sunset Beach Clubs, witnessing their efforts to maintain a cleaner beachfront. The quality of the beach had improved compared to the previous week, thanks to the meticulous cleaning and maintenance performed by the local authorities. The Playa Del Carmen Phase 1 beach area demonstrated a notable improvement, offering visitors a more enjoyable beach experience.\nPlaya Del Carmen Phase 2 Finally, we arrived at Playa Del Carmen Phase 2, where the water still bore a brownish-green hue near the beachline. Although not completely clear, the conditions were significantly better than the previous week. Considering it is August, typically the peak of seaweed season, this can be considered a positive outcome. While some areas within the Playa Del Carmen Hotel Zone experienced heavier seaweed accumulation, the overall situation in Playa Del Carmen has improved.\nIn conclusion, the efforts of the local municipality and beach resorts have resulted in a cleaner and more enjoyable beach experience for visitors to Playa Del Carmen. While seaweed may still be present in some areas, the situation has significantly improved compared to previous years. Visitors can look forward to a beach vacation without being significantly impacted by seaweed during their stay.\nIf you found this beach seaweed update helpful, please consider supporting us by visiting buy me a coffee.com/360.
