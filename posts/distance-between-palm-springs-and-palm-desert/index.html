Look no further! In this comprehensive travel guide, we will provide you with all the information you need to know before you go. From getting in and getting around, to what to see, eat, and do, we’ve got you covered. Let’s dive in and explore the beautiful city of Palm Springs.\nA Brief Introduction to Palm Springs Before we begin, let’s talk about the background of Palm Springs. This resort destination rose to fame in the 1950s when Hollywood stars flocked here for relaxation by the swimming pool. With a population of just over 400,000, there are ten thousand palm trees in the Palm Springs area, giving the city its name. Although there are no hot springs in the city itself, you can find them in Desert Hot Springs, just north of Palm Springs.\nApart from its reputation as a pool destination, Palm Springs is also known for its hiking trails and mid-century architecture. The city boasts the most mid-century architectural buildings in the United States, making it feel like a time warp back to the 1950s and 60s.\nGetting to Palm Springs To reach Palm Springs, most people prefer to drive from Los Angeles, which takes approximately two hours. If you’re coming from San Diego, the drive is also about two hours. For those traveling from Phoenix or Las Vegas, expect a four-hour journey. If you don’t have a car, you can take the Flix bus from downtown Los Angeles, which starts at around $20. Alternatively, Palm Springs has its own airport, PSP, with multiple carriers and routes, including some to the east coast of the United States.\nGetting Around Palm Springs Palm Springs is a driving town due to its desert location and the long distances between attractions. The roads are wide and speed limits are generally high, making driving a convenient option. However, if you don’t have a car, ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft are readily available. Palm Springs also has a few walkable areas, such as El Paseo in Palm Desert and Downtown Palm Springs. These areas are great for shopping and dining, but do note that stores in El Paseo tend to close early, so plan your visit accordingly.\nWhen to Visit Palm Springs With over 300 days of sunshine a year, almost every day is perfect for lounging by the pool in Palm Springs. However, summers can be scorching hot, with temperatures reaching the high hundreds (110 degrees Fahrenheit). The high season in Palm Springs is from January to May when the weather is pleasant without being too hot. If you prefer a quieter time to visit, December, before Christmas, offers lower room rates and daytime temperatures that rarely drop below 70 degrees, perfect for enjoying the pool.\nFood in Palm Springs Palm Springs is a food lover’s paradise, with two main foodie hubs to explore. Palm Desert’s El Paseo is known for its upscale dining options, including high-end steakhouses, California cuisine, and a fantastic Mexican restaurant called Mole. Downtown Palm Springs is the place to go for outdoor dining, thanks to its abundance of sunny days. Craft cocktails, local breweries, distilleries, and wineries can be found throughout the city. If you’re looking for a tasty meal, we recommend trying Reuben and Ozzie’s Oyster Grill for fresh oysters and delicious pasta.\nWhere to Stay in Palm Springs When it comes to accommodation, there are several options to suit different preferences. Downtown Palm Springs is a great choice if you want a central location where you can walk to most places. However, keep in mind that the hotels in this area may not be as luxurious as those in Palm Desert. For upscale resorts and amenities, consider staying in East Palm Desert, such as the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort. It’s worth noting that Palm Springs can be quite expensive when it comes to hotel rates, so be prepared to pay slightly more for your stay. Many hotels in the area offer large swimming pools, perfect for families with children.\nIt’s essential to choose a hotel that aligns with your needs and preferences. For the LGBTQ+ community, Palm Springs offers numerous hotels and resorts catering specifically to this demographic. However, if you’re traveling with kids, be aware that there are also many adult-only hotels and resorts in the area.\nThings to Do in Palm Springs Palm Springs offers a wide range of activities and attractions for visitors to enjoy. Here are a few highlights:\nDowntown Palm Springs: Take a stroll through the downtown area and explore the Walk of Fame where you can find golden Palm Stars honoring Palm Springs celebrities.\nHiking: Palm Springs is a hiker’s paradise, with numerous trails to explore. Keep in mind that some trails charge admission fees, especially those located on Native American land, and many close early. Don’t miss the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, which offers a unique hiking experience and stunning views from an elevation of 8,000 feet.\nCasinos: If you’re feeling lucky, check out the variety of casinos in Palm Springs and its surroundings. These establishments offer plenty of gaming options and entertainment.\nCabazon Dinosaurs: Make a stop at Cabazon Dinosaurs, where you’ll find the world’s largest dinosaurs. These iconic statues have appeared in movies and provide a fun photo opportunity for the whole family.\nGiant Wind Turbines: As you drive into Palm Springs, you’ll notice the towering wind turbines that generate power due to the area’s strong winds. It’s a fascinating sight and a great view from the car window.\nJoshua Tree National Park: Located just northeast of Palm Springs, Joshua Tree National Park offers breathtaking scenic beauty, unique wildlife, and incredible rock formations. It’s an ideal destination for hiking, rock climbing, and stargazing.\nConclusion Palm Springs is a vibrant and diverse destination that offers something for everyone. From its rich history and beautiful architecture to outdoor activities and delectable dining options, this charming city is sure to leave a lasting impression. So pack your bags, get your sunscreen ready, and embark on an unforgettable adventure in Palm Springs, California.\n(Note: The keywords “Palm Springs” and “travel guide” have been incorporated throughout the article to enhance SEO.)\n","wordCount":"1031","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Wesson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/distance-between-palm-springs-and-palm-desert/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Go Hitch Hiking","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gohitchhiking.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Go Hitch Hiking (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Go Hitch Hiking</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gohitchhiking.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>**Palm Springs Travel Guide: Everything You Need to Know**</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 12, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1031 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mary Wesson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#a-brief-introduction-to-palm-springs><strong>A Brief Introduction to Palm Springs</strong></a></li><li><a href=#getting-to-palm-springs><strong>Getting to Palm Springs</strong></a></li><li><a href=#getting-around-palm-springs><strong>Getting Around Palm Springs</strong></a></li><li><a href=#when-to-visit-palm-springs><strong>When to Visit Palm Springs</strong></a></li><li><a href=#food-in-palm-springs><strong>Food in Palm Springs</strong></a></li><li><a href=#where-to-stay-in-palm-springs><strong>Where to Stay in Palm Springs</strong></a></li><li><a href=#things-to-do-in-palm-springs><strong>Things to Do in Palm Springs</strong></a></li><li><a href=#conclusion><strong>Conclusion</strong></a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EQN-YBNiU0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Are you planning a trip to Palm Springs, California?
