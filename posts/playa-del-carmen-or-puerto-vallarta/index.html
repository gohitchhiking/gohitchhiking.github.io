Both the Caribbean and Pacific sides of Mexico have their own unique and stunning features. In this article, we will compare the major highlights of both destinations to help you decide whether Puerto Vallarta or the Cancun/Riviera Maya area is better suited for your dream vacation.\nCancun and Riviera Maya: The Perfect Tropical All-Inclusive Getaway\nIf you’re looking for a tropical all-inclusive vacation, Cancun and the Riviera Maya are ideal destinations. Whether you’re traveling with family, looking for kid-friendly activities and adventurous excursions, or a couple on their honeymoon seeking an ultra-luxurious retreat, this side of Mexico has it all. You can lounge by the pool, enjoy swim-up bars, walk along the beautiful beaches, and not have to leave your resort for an entire week. It is perfect for those who want a relaxing and pampered vacation experience.\nPuerto Vallarta: Immerse Yourself in Authentic Mexico\nOn the other hand, Puerto Vallarta offers a more authentic Mexican experience. While you still have the option to stay at an all-inclusive resort, you also have the opportunity to immerse yourself in the heart of downtown at a vacation rental or an Airbnb. Puerto Vallarta has a unique charm with its cobblestone streets, Spanish colonial buildings, beach boardwalks lined with shops, restaurants, and bars, and the jungle and mountain terrain that leads to great outdoor adventures. It is an ideal destination for travelers who want to experience the local culture and explore the surrounding areas.\nFamily-Friendly Activities and Adventures\nBoth Puerto Vallarta and the Riviera Maya offer plenty of options for families. They have resorts and hotels with kids clubs and water parks on-site. Additionally, there are numerous adventure activities to enjoy such as snorkeling, whale watching, cenote swimming, ATV tours, and zip-lining. No matter which destination you choose, you can ensure that your family will have a memorable and fun-filled vacation.\nPrice Comparison: Puerto Vallarta vs. Cancun/Riviera Maya\nIn general, Puerto Vallarta is slightly cheaper than Cancun and the Riviera Maya. If you prefer an independent-style of travel and enjoy planning your own adventures, Puerto Vallarta is the perfect choice. On the other hand, if you prefer a vacation package where everything is included and planned out for you, Cancun and the Riviera Maya offer excellent options. Consider your travel preferences and budget when deciding between these two destinations.\nBeaches and Water: Caribbean vs. Pacific\nThe Caribbean side of Mexico, including Cancun and the Riviera Maya, is known for its tropical and exotic white sandy beaches with turquoise blue water. It is the picture-perfect tropical vacation destination. However, it’s important to note that the Caribbean side experiences issues with sargassum, a type of seaweed that washes up on shore and can turn the water a light brown or beige color. On the other hand, the Pacific side of Mexico, where Puerto Vallarta is located, has more golden and grainier beaches. However, you can still find pockets of softer and lighter-colored sand if you know where to look. Additionally, the beaches in Puerto Vallarta are more swimmable due to its location in Banderas Bay, which protects the area from large swells.\nWeather and Climate: When to Visit\nIn Cancun and the Riviera Maya, high season typically runs from January to April, with shoulder months on each side still being pleasant. The weather can be more humid during these months. In Puerto Vallarta, most tourists visit from December to March when the weather is consistently pleasant but can be somewhat cool at night. November and April are considered shoulder season months but still offer great weather and fewer tourists. May to July is very hot in Puerto Vallarta, and this is when many locals tend to vacation in the area. On the Caribbean side, it is advisable to avoid visiting from September to November, as it is hurricane season and can be windier and rainier during these months.\nActivities, Excursions, and Sightseeing\nIn the Riviera Maya, the must-visit attractions are the cenotes (underground freshwater pools and river systems) and the Mayan ruins. There are plenty of cenotes and ruins to explore, and they are unique to this side of Mexico. Additionally, there is excellent snorkeling, especially if you take a tour to the hidden islands full of marine life. A full-day tour to Chichen Itza, one of the new seven wonders of the world, is highly recommended. It includes a visit to the beautiful city of Valladolid, known for its Spanish colonial downtown center. There are also various biospheres and nature reserves to explore, especially on a day trip to Holbox Island, where you can swim with whale sharks.\nIn Puerto Vallarta, strolling the malacon (boardwalk along the beach) is a must-do activity. The zona romantica (old downtown) is another unique draw of this area, with its beautiful streets that blend Spanish and Mexican architecture. There are endless options for day trips to small fishing villages or surfer towns to experience the local culture. Natural hot springs, hiking trails through the coastal mountains and jungle terrain, and whale watching from December through March are some of the other highlights of Puerto Vallarta.\nAccommodations and Safety\nThe Riviera Maya is mostly known for its all-inclusive resorts that line the coast. From two-star to luxury five-star resorts, you can find accommodation options for every budget. Playa del Carmen also offers smaller authentic hotels and excellent restaurants, providing a nice balance between a vibrant city and a beach getaway. In Puerto Vallarta, you’ll find high-end luxury resorts, small boutique hotels, locally-owned accommodations, vacation rentals, and affordable hotels. The romantic zone, in particular, offers a mix of locals and tourists, with beautiful properties overlooking the river in a quiet area.\nBoth the Riviera Maya and Puerto Vallarta are considered safe for tourists. However, it is always advisable to practice situational awareness, especially when walking around in Puerto Vallarta’s city center. Keeping your belongings secure and close to your body is a good practice. It’s important to note that there are some scams that tourists should be aware of in Puerto Vallarta, especially if it’s their first time visiting. For more information on this, refer to the blog post about scams in Puerto Vallarta specifically for first-time travelers.\nConclusion: Choose Your Dream Vacation Destination\nIn conclusion, choosing between Cancun/Riviera Maya and Puerto Vallarta depends on your travel preferences and what kind of vacation experience you’re looking for. If you want a tropical all-inclusive getaway with beautiful beaches and luxurious resorts, Cancun and the Riviera Maya are perfect for you. On the other hand, if you want to immerse yourself in authentic Mexican culture, explore charming streets, and have a more budget-friendly experience, Puerto Vallarta is an excellent choice. Both destinations offer plenty of activities, adventures, and sightseeing opportunities that will make your vacation unforgettable.
